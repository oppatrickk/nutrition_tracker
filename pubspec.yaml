# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/images/default_avatar.png
  - assets/images/apple.png
  - .env

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: SFProDisplay
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/SFProRegular.OTF
         - asset: assets/fonts/SFProBold.OTF
         - asset: assets/fonts/SFProHeavy.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/SFProMedium.OTF

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
